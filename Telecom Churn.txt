Capstone Project on “Churn at Mobicom”:
MobiCom is concern about the market environment of rising customer churn and declining ARPU as churn rate at MobiCom is High. Analyzed the factors influencing the churn behaviour and created a Dashboard on
validation of data usage connectivity issues for Mobicom. Given data has 81 features and 66297 records, each describes overall usage of customer, demographic information and subscription status in feature churn.

Analyzed the telecom churn rate data provided by Jigsaw Learning Center and built a logistic regression model using backward selection of variable and validation of model and its assumptions. Predicted churn rate for each customer and target segment of
customers for proactive retention strategy.

Technique Used: R, Logistic Regression, Descriptive Statistics, Variable profiling and ggplot2

Business Questions:
#1. What are the top five factors driving likelihood of churn at Mobicom?
head(sort(abs(mod5$coefficients),decreasing = T),10)
summary(mod5)
#Factor                  coefficient
#1.retdays_n1             0.6574813
#2.asl_flag_n_Group2      0.4734461
#3.hnd_price_n_Group3     0.4164027
#4.area_n_Group3          0.3644660
#5.hnd_price_n_Group2     0.2708792

#Special offers should be given to customers who makes retention calls 
#Special plans should be rolled out for customers located in NORTHWEST/ROCKY MOUNTAIN AREA
#and SOUTH FLORIDA AREA

#2. Validation of survey findings
#a) Whether "cost and billing" and "network and service quality" are important factors
#influencing churn behaviour?
#Variables affects cost and billing are
------------------------------------------
#1. totmrc_Mean - Monthly Recurring Charge is the base cost of the calling plan regardless of actual minutes used.
#2. rev_range - Range of revenue (charge amount)
#3. ovrrev_Mean - DATOVR_MEAN + VCEOVR_MEAN.Mean overage revenue is the sum of data and voice overage revenues.
#4. totrev-Total revenue
  
#Beta Coefficients
mod5$coefficients
#totmrc_Mean :(-)0.0063960681 
#rev_range   :0.0019711383
#ovrrev_Mean :0.0066317704
#totrev      :0.0002317941 

#Above beta values shows that unit increase of those variables has no impact on the 
#churn. So cost and billing is not an important factor influencing churn behaviour

#Variables affects network and service quality are
#1. mou_Range -Range of number of minutes of use
#2. change_mou -Percentage change in monthly minutes of use vs previous three month average
#3. drop_blk_Mean - Mean number of dropped or blocked calls
#4. drop_vce_Range- Range of number of dropped (failed) voice calls
#5. mou_opkv_Range - Range of unrounded minutes of use of off-peak voice calls
#6. iwylis_vce_Mean - Mean number of inbound wireless to wireless voice calls
#7. avgqty - Average monthly number of calls over the life of the customer
#8. avg6mou - Average monthly minutes of use over the previous six months
#9. adjmou - Billing adjusted total minutes of use over the life of the customer
#10. retdays_n - Number of days since last retention call
#11. complete_Mean - COMP_DAT_MEAN + COMP_VCE_MEAN. Mean number of completed calls.

#mou_Range         :0.0002562910 
#change_mou        :(-)0.0006289187
#drop_blk_Mean     :0.0071641598

#retdays_n         :0.6574813402
#complete_Mean     :(-)0.0020419077

#Above values shows that retdays_n is an important factor influencing the churn behaviour. 
#As the number of days increases after the customer making the retention call, chances of churning is high.
#Special attention has to be given for those customers by providing special offers


#2b. Are the data usage connectivity issues turning out to be costly?In other words, is it leading to churn?
# Varaibles related to data usage connectivity are
#1. comp_dat_Mean :Mean number of completed data calls
#2. plcd_dat_Mean :Mean number of attempted data calls placed
#3. opk_dat_Mean  :Mean number of off-peak data calls
#4. blck_dat_Mean :Mean number of blocked (failed) data calls
#5. datovr_Mean   :Mean revenue of data overage
#6. datovr_Range  :Range of revenue of data overage
#7. drop_dat_Mean :Mean number of dropped (failed) data calls

#Only 10 to 15% of the customers making the data calls 
#Work towards achiving more customers to use internet and provide quality data connectivity to reduce the churn
#There is no enough usable data for those variables to show the impact on churn


#3. Would your recommend rate plan migration as a proactive retention strategy?
#OVERREV_MEAN = DATOVR_MEAN + VCEOVR_MEAN - Mean overage revenue is the sum of data and voice overage revenues.
#Beta coefficient of ovrrev_Mean is 0.0066317704. The impact of this variable is less on the churn behaviour
#This may be the concern for individual customers but overall migration plan might not help much.


#4. What would be your recommendation on how to use this churn model for prioritisation
# of customers for a proactive retention compaigns in the future?

#5. What would be the target segments for proactive retention compaigns?
#Mobicom would like to save their high revenue customers besides manging churn
#Given a budget constraint of a contact list of 20% of subscriber pool which
#subscribers should prioritised if "revenue saves" is also a priority besides
#controlling churn
#controlling churn is the primary objective and revenue saves is the secondary objective
